2. **Add Video:**
   - Place 8-second video in `assets/videos/8-second-story.mp4`

3. **Replace Placeholders:**
   - In each HTML file, find placeholder divs
   - Uncomment the `<img>` or `<video>` tags
   - Remove or comment out placeholder divs

4. **Open Website:**

## 📧 Contact Form

The contact form uses a mailto link to send emails to:

For production, you'll want to replace this with a backend service.

The live chat widget includes automated messages:
- "Hello! 👋 How can we help you today?"
- "Are you interested in our services?"
- "We'll reply in under 2 minutes."
- "Would you like a free consultation?"
